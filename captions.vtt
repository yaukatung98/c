00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.140
For this presentation I am going to present the movie

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.740
This movie is different from other episodes

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.380
Because of the main characters of this series aren't in this episode

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.060
For example Vin Diesel and Paul Walker

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.640
Both of them aren't here

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.340
If you have watched F&amp;F 6

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.080
You would know that at the end of the movie

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.760
After Han's girlfriend dies

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.720
He goes back to Tokyo by himself

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.000
The story of F&amp;F: Tokyo Drift is about

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.460
How Han trains a boy to become one of the best racers in Tokyo

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.920
The movie starts with a drag race

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.660
Sean has an argument with the Viper Boi

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.420
So they decide to race to see who is better

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.920
But the match ends up with the Viper Boi hitting the cement pillar

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.880
and Sean crashes

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.040
After that, Sean gets arrested by the police

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.600
The police officer tells Sean's mom that

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.740
Sean can no longer stay in the states

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.460
Otherwise, he has to go to jail

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.980
So his mom decides to send him to Japan

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.980
where his father lives

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.240
Dad makes a rule for him

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.040
He can not touch cars from now on

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.600
He must go do school every single day

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.280
and come back home before 10 pm

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.520
There is one day, Sean notices his classmate Twinkie

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.740
has a steering wheel in his backpack

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.960
Twinkie tells him, he likes cars as well

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.000
So Sean asks Twinkie to bring him to the secret Japanese car meet

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.520
From here, Nina shows up

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.640
Sean steps up and talks to her

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.760
But unfortunately, Nina's boyfriend, DK sees that

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.120
Dk talks poop to Sean

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.640
They look down on each other

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.015
So they decide to give a  race

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.160
to find out who is better

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.960
But Sean doesn't have a car

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.620
Then Han gives his car for Sean to use

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.020
Twinkie tells Sean

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.380
Dk is one of the best drifters in Japan

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.140
But Sean doesn't know how to drift

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.940
So he asks Twinkie how to drift

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.120
Twinkie says, just don't crash Han's car

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.080
The race begins

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.380
Sean gives a full throttle

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.520
but he doesn't notice there is a 90 degrees corner

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.920
thus he hits on the pillar real hard

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.780
Dk clutch kicks his 350Z and shows up in front of Sean

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.380
Wal Tap is a perfection

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.200
But Sean still trying his best to chase him

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.960
Of course, DK wins

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.880
Sean crashes Han's S15 into a piece of scrap iron

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.280
A while later, Sean goes back home

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.360
His dad has been waiting for him to come home

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.720
but then dad finds out Sean went to race again

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.400
He decides to send Sean back to the states

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.200
But Sean doesn't give a dang

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.680
So dad is really angry

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.440
Because if he ever gets caught again

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.600
he can only go to jail

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:49.520
On the second day

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.680
Sean notices everyone is watching him

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.720
It turns out that the last night event

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.720
has spread all over the area

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.760
Han has been waiting for him outside of school with his RX7

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.140
Han brings him to where DK works

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.620
Dk's subordinate, the emo kid really hates Sean

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.400
Sean tells the emo kid

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.320
You wanna do a race or nah

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.240
The reason why Han is here is to do business with DK

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.100
Also, use one of their cars as a bet

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.240
Let Sean and the emo kid do a race

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.680
If the emo kid loses, DK has to give one of the cars to him

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.720
After that, Han brings Sean to his garage

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.700
Han gives his read wheel drive EVO 9 to Sean

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.200
Hoping Sean could beat up DK for him

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.120
Then Han starts a plan on teaching Sean how to drift

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.960
But Sean drifts like poop at the beginning

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.340
no one could even look at it

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.480
Not even the finishing uncles

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.220
But as time goes by

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.660
Sean's drifting skills are getting stronger

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.760
Han also asks Sean to live with him

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.160
So he could help Sean to maximize his drifting skills

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.860
Finally, Sean beats up the emo kid

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.940
DK obeys the promise, gives the car key to Han

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.420
Sean also successfully gets the attention of Nina

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.980
After the race, they go for food together

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
During this time

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.240
Nina tells Sean that her mom died when she was a little

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.940
She was brought up by DK's uncle

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.140
However, DK's uncle is the boss of the local mafia

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.680
Then, Nina shows off her Tandem skills to Sean

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.200
After knowing this, DK goes to Han's garage

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.100
and punches right in Sean's face

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.180
Also warms him don't talk to Nina anymore

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.200
Dk's uncle also tells him

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.780
Han's business with DK was fake

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.500
Han uses DK to trick Dk's uncle for laundering

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.700
DK is really angry after knowing this

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.400
He brings guns and rushes to Han's garage

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.020
Twinkie finds out something is not right

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.020
So he emergency evacuates everyone in the garage

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.460
Sean and Nina hop into Sean's car

00:04:31.465 --> 00:04:33.165
Han also leaves

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.240
Sean doesn't care about the emo kid

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.200
hit right in front of him

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.440
Soon, the emo kid catches them

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.020
but he doesn't realize he is on the other side of the lane

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.560
both his car and unlucky's car get critical damage

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.720
DK gets angrier after seeing this

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.400
he hits Seans' car very brutally and trying to stop him

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.240
Han decides to let himself to solve this trouble maker

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.620
DK does a 180 spin and now is able to face Han

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.360
he brings out the pistol trying to kill Han

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.180
Out of sudden, Han gets hit from the right side

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.680
The car explodes after the crash

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.180
Sean brings Nina to his house

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.560
But suddenly, DK comes and wants to kill Sean

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.480
But Dad saves Sean

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.660
Then Nina decides to go with DK in order to save Sean

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.160
Dad asks Sean to go back to the states immediately

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.560
But Sean doesn't want to

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.760
He says he has to take the responsibility

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.760
he decides to stay and defeat DK

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.180
Twinkie gives Sean a bag of money

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.520
says its the laundering money from DK's uncle

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.220
see if he could let Sean and Nina go safely

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.040
So Sean goes to ask DK's uncle

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.020
But DK's uncle not willing to

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.740
unless he could win a race against DK

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.540
then he would willing to let Nina go

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.340
They find out the crashed S15 is still in the garage

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.080
and the engine is still in good condition

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.180
So his dad decides to give his mustang frame to Sean

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.480
After that, Sean carefully tune each part for the race

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.200
It's the race day

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.560
Dk's uncle is also here

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.160
This is a terrifying touge (mountain pass)

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.460
A tiny distraction could result in the death of the driver

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.700
DK is way too fast for the first corner

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.300
The understeer condition gives Sean a chance to pass him

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.940
After that, DK is forcing his car's limitation in order to win the race

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.680
But Sean still passes DK at the few corners before the finish line

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.020
So DK decides to crash Sean off the cliff

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.580
But Sean outplayed DK by hitting the brake

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.780
The misprediction leads himself running off the track

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.540
As a result, Sean wins the race

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.140
Dk's uncle also let Sean and Nina continue to stay in Japan safely

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.820
At the end of the movie, Vin Diesel shows up

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.260
He tells Sean he is Han's brother

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.400
He hopes he could have a race with brother's student

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.820
After that, the movie ends

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.760
The reason why I pick this movie is

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.720
this movie is really different than other episodes

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.580
This episode has more focus on the actual cars

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.880
not the shooting actions like any others

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.740
Also, the action director for this episode is Keiichi Tsuchiya

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.320
He is also the prototype of the main character of Initial D

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.080
And the fishing uncle in this episode is Keiichi Tsuchiya

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.580
I feel like If we put the plot of this episode aside

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.140
It's still enjoyable just to be able to watch the drifting clips

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.680
If you have watched F&amp;F 7, you would know that

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.860
The one who hit Han in this episode is Deckard Shawn

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.220
but Han didn't die because of the car explosion

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.580
Because he is back again in the latest episode F&amp;F 9

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.460
If you would like to watch more episodes of this series

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.940
The correct squeal order of F&amp;F is

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.800
 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.140
 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.540
This is my final Project

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.420
Thanks for watching
